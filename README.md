#What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG)

## Description
In this exercise, we were directed to have javascript create several person elements. Once the elements were created, odd numbered elements needed to have a different background than the evenly numbered elements.

Other features include:
* When enter is hit, the input field is cleared.
* When a bio is clicked, the bio text immediately fills the input field.
* When a user edits the text inside the input field, the change is replicated in the DOM.

## How to run
In your terminal, run:
```
http-server -p 4040
```
then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser.
